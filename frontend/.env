# In dev, the Vite proxy is used. Normally you do not need VITE_API_URL.
# If you want to bypass the proxy and call the backend directly, uncomment below:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Optional voice features (endpoints not implemented in current backend)
# VITE_TTS_ENABLED=true
# VITE_STS_ENABLED=true
